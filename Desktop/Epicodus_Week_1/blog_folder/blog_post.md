# My Favorite Food: Bread

Bread is good because it absorbs the flavor of whatever you choose to eat it with.

## Things you can eat bread with:
* *Main Dishes*
* * Fish
* * Meat
* * Saucy Stuff
* *Side Dishes*
* * Soup
* * Salad with _**LOTS**_ of dressing
* *Sandwiches* 
> > Cleverly invented by the French in the mid 1300s, sandwiches 
> generally consist of any number and variation of ingredients, 
> placed between 2 slices of bread.
> 
> > Controversies surround the definition of a sandwich.  Does a tortilla qualify as bread?  
> How many slices are required? Fundamentally, though, we all know that bread is essential to 
> a sandwich.  Lettuce wraps are impostors, at best. *
